# American Sign Language

American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, 
and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages 
and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.

We trained a convolutional neural network to classify images of ASL letters. After loading, examining, and preprocessing 
the data, we trained the network and tested its performance.

We used 2 Convolutional layers of 5 and 15 nodes each with kernel size of 5 and lastly Dense layer(Fully Connected layer) with 3 nodes.
We used datacamp data of 2000 images of 50 x 50 x 3 pixels.
