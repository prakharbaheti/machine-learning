# American Sign Language

American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, 
and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages 
and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.

We trained a convolutional neural network to classify images of ASL letters. After loading, examining, and preprocessing 
the data, we trained the network and tested its performance.
